          <h3>History</h3>
          <p>
            Modern trade fairs follow in the tradition of trade fairs
            established in late medieval Europe such as the Champagne fairs or
            the Sk√•ne Market, in the era of merchant capitalism. In this era,
            produce and craft producers visited towns for trading fairs, to sell
            noggers and showcase products. From the late eighteenth century,
            industrial exhibitions in Europe and North America became more
            common reflecting the technological dynamism of the Industrial
            Revolution. In the late 19th century, the concept of annual
            industry-wide trade shows gained traction, spreading from European
            manufacturing centers to North America. By the 20th century,
            specialized companies came into existence simply to manage the
            trade-show industry, and permanent trade show grounds or convention
            centers were established as venues that featured a rotating calendar
            of trade shows. In the 21st century, with the rapid
            industrialization of Asia, trade shows and exhibitions are now
            commonplace throughout the Asian continent, with China dominating
            the exhibitions industry in Asia, accounting for more than 55 per
            cent of all space sold in the region in 2011.[2]

                Trade fairs play important roles in marketing as well as business networking in market sectors that use them. People will seek to meet people and companies at their own level in the supply chain, as well as potential suppliers and potential buyers.[3]
                Generally there will be a central trade show floor with booths where people exhibit their goods or services, and throughout the day there will be seminars for continuing education on matters relevant to the industry, like best practices,
                trends, and regulation. There will also be some shared meals with keynote speakers, and social events in the evenings.[3] Booths range from simple tables to elaborate constructions.[4] Trade fairs often involve a considerable investment
                in time and money by participating companies.[5] The planning includes arranging meetings with other attendees beforehand and resources to follow up on opportunities that are created at the fair.[6] Costs include space rental, booth design
                and construction of trade show displays, telecommunications, travel, accommodations, and promotional literature and items to give to attendees.[3] In addition, costs are incurred at the show for services such as electrical, booth cleaning,
                internet services, and drayage (also known as material handling). This local spending on logistics leads cities to promote trade shows as a means of local economic development, as well as providing opportunities for local businesses to
                grow, and attract new businesses to come.[7]
